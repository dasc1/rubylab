Challenge: zz_script

INSTALLATION - UBUNTU LINUX

Ruby is undoubtedly available in the apt-get packages.  You can simply
apt-get install the "ruby" package, but this may give you an older
version that you don't want.  To ensure that you get version 1.9.3,
for example, try:

>>> sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.3

When the installation script finishes, you can type the following
command to see what version of ruby you have installed:

>>> ruby --version

In this folder, there is a ruby script called "helloworld.rb".  Run
it by opening a terminal in this directory, and typing:

>>> ruby helloworld.rb
